            From a career grounded in consulting and data analytics for high-growth startups, I've largely been responsible for finding opportunities to scale within large amounts of data.
            <br/><br/>I'm on the path to becoming a full-stack software developer, with the ultimate goal of launching multiple startups by building the stoftware stack from the ground up.
